        role: ["Software Engineer", "Backend Developer", "Full Stack Developer"],
        subject: ["Memory Management", "Computer Science Fundamentals"],
        explanation: "Stack memory is used for static memory allocation and stores local variables, function parameters, and return addresses. Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation where variables are allocated and freed in any order.",
